#### Event: Trump called Covi-19 Chinese Virus
Of course, he is a racist, it will course hatred between Chinese and American.
The local will discrimate chinese American, but why trump tweeted like this?
1. Because he want to be elected again, The president election is coming, his
   potential opponent Biden has some bussiness in China, and Trump want to use
   this to defeat Biden, 
2. The other reason is he don't want to take responsibility at all. American
   people will belame China for the bad econemy, but not Donald Trump.
3. The lesson I can learn from this event is if **you want to defeat you opponent,
   The most important thing is to figure out what he want to, and this make
   sense, in all relationship**

#### Mayun: donated masks and test kits to American.
1. Mayun is not just a businessman, he needs to service the RPC. 
2. The amount Mayun is a piece of iceberg, what does he want, just show some
   kindness, he is not stupid, he is not an angel.
3. His donation will cases big problem for American, how to fairly distribute
   this masks to everyone, and now all Ameircan people know China has masks and
   test kits. So the goverment can't contine lie to people, we don't have test
   kits.

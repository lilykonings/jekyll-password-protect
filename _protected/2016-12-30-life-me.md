#### A friend
A friend came to kyoto to join the symposium. 
In the daytime, we went to kyoto tower and arashiyama. In the evening, we
shopped at takashiyama and eated beef at kawaramachi. 
I was impressed by one sentence he said, "one time is enough" <br />

#### Lesson
After I come to Japan, for a lot of reason, I was in debt about 50,000YEN, finaly,
I pay them all, I never want to be in debt any more. I suffered a lot. Everyday,
I open my eyes, The feeling that you have a lot money to pay, That's terrible.
